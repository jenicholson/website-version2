Pi day is celebrated on March 14 every year.  This is because the numerical value of pi is 3.14.  Please enjoy my favorite pie chart made with R.




```r
par(mar = c(0, 1, 0, 1))
pie(
  c(280, 60, 20),
  c('Sky', 'Sunny side of pyramid', 'Shady side of pyramid'),
  col = c('#0292D8', '#F7EA39', '#C4B632'),
  init.angle = -50, border = NA
)
```
